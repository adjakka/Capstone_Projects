The process of granting loans has been a complex process that involves a number of variables like age, applicant income, 
credit history, loan amount, loan amount term and so on. If done manually, it could be a tedious and time consuming 
process. Hence, building a machine learning model to automate decisions is one approach that will save time and man power. 
This project explores the various machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting) that could be used. These models are then evaluated based on certain 
performance metrics and the best machine learning algorithm will be suggested for implementation.

Toolkit: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn(GradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, 
LogisticRegression, Support Vector Machines(SVM)), scipy.stats
